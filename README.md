# Documentation for Embedded State of Charge (SOC) Algorithm for Lead Acid Battery 
Documentation (Projektarbeit) for Projekt-Labor @ Beuth University for Applied Science.

This document describes the research, implementation and verification of an embedded State of Charge (SOC) algorithm for lead acid batteries. The Algo is based on KalmanFilter (KF). It can be used for lithium batteries as well, if the open circuit voltage (OCV) lookup-table is adjusted acordingly. 

**Build/Compile the Latex document**

Linux:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/mulles/Doc_Projekt-Labor_SOC`  
`$ cd Doc_Projekt-Labor_SOC`  
`$ make` or compile with TeXStudio a Latex IDE 

COULDDO Add CI to build on remote machine aka server
