\subsection{Definition Mathematics Equations }
 
Describe Model equation: 
Make a diagram where you can see the input output and steps
-State equation f() (input: measured current and time-period -> Coulomb Counting)
-Measurement equation h(), input (measured voltage, OCV lookup table, current if the correction with a Enhanced Self-Correcting (ESC) Cell Model /ECM) -> output SOC)
equation should be use standard letters: filterpy, wikipedia, gregoryPlett, Step by Step Guide

\section{Kalman-SOC}
A Fork of Okra-Solar Algorithm. \

Features: \

-Works without the input of a Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) specific to the physical battery, which would need to be parameterized doing advanced measurements during charging and discharging of the battery. 

-Inputs: Current and Voltage Measurements and OCV Lookup Table

-Outputs: SOC in \%Wh

TODO Discuss the Code Snippets? But Some Code in Appendix or reference Github Repo only? 
\chapter{Validation}

Integrated matplotlib inline with pythontex

Discuss results.  (4d)
